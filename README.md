## Introduction

This session aims to introduce the use of Docker containers with the goal of using them to effect reproducible computational environments. Such environments are useful for ensuring reproducible research outputs, for example.

The practical work in this lesson is primarily aimed at using Docker on your own laptop. Beyond your laptop, software container technologies such as Docker can also be used in the cloud and on high performance computing (HPC) systems. Some of the material in this lesson will be applicable to those environments too.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this workshop, you will:

- Have an understanding of what Docker containers are, why they are useful
  and the common terminology used
- Have a working Docker installation on your local system to allow you to
  use containers
- Understand how to use existing Docker containers for common tasks
- Be able to build your own Docker containers by understanding both the role
  of a `Dockerfile` in building containers, and the syntax used in `Dockerfile`s
- Understand how to manage Docker containers on your local system
- Appreciate issues around reproducibility in software, understand how
  containers can address some of these issues and what the limits to
  reproducibility using containers are
